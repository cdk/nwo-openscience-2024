We want to report for each tool being upgraded the following things:

## Source code
* where to download the source code: http://yapcwsoft.com/dd/padeldescriptor/
* which CDK version where they using (PaDEL Descriptor version 2.21 was using CDK 1.4.15)
* what website to link to / how to acknowledge the previous source --> to be clarified

## Code analysis
* which Java packages are being used
* to help find the maven modules that are dependencies
* what functionality is being used
* record larger dependency eco-system (e.g. which tools depend on this tool)
* how the code is being compile and executed
* how to the code is tested

## Upgrading tools
* what CDK API change affected the upgrade (e.g. SMARTCyp to CDK 2.0 has IMolecule2IAtomContainer and IChemObjectBuilder)
* what testing results before and after the upgrade
  * who was involved?

## Reporting results
* where were the results announced?
* how was the upgrade received/ used?
