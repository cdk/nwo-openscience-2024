grant accepted for the CDK in 2023.

## Abstract

Cheminformatics is the research field that deals with information about chemical systems. This includes the
chemical structure which is used in computational chemistry where quantum chemistry is too complex. The
Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) was one of the first Open Science libraries in chemistry, co-founded in The
Netherlands. The source code goes as far back as 1997 and has been maintained for more than 25 years. The CDK
is used by many tools in drug discovery, computational toxicology, and bioinformatics. This project will develop
improvements to the core library and update tools using the CDK to use the latest release.
